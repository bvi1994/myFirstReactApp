Dear [player],

You are Wigglytuff, from Pokemon Mastery Dungeon Explorer series. As a child, you influence in being an explorer with an outlaw Armaldo. You have since then become a great explorer up to where you were a former member of Team Charm and now the guild master of your own Exploration Guild.

Because you are a guild master, you have the following abilities:

[list]Twice per game, you can be a double voter. You may PM the hosts [b]”Perfect Apples! Of course they’re perfect![/b] up to two times in any day phase to be a double voter. Your vote will count as two votes at the end of that day phase. This double vote will not appear until the end of the day phase. [/list]

[list]Once per day, you can be a mayor. During any day phase, you may PM the hosts [b]”Lets be friends! Yoom-tah!”[/b] one during the game. The day phase will end in a “No Lynch,” regardless of players who have the most votes.[/list]

You may only use one day action per day phase.

Also, because of your close relationship with Chatot, you also share a mason chat with Chatot. You may contact your Mason [url=<insert URL here]here[/url]. Your Mason is aligned with town.

In short, you are a [b]Mason Double Voting Mayor[/b] allied with the [b][color=green]exploration teams[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
