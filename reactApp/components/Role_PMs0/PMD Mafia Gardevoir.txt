Dear (???)

[spoiler][img]https://s19.postimg.org/5ahuqsnlf/PMD_Gardevoir.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Gardevoir, an agent of the spirits who watches over Humans who have become pokemon in our world.  You were once the partner of a Human pokemon trainer who came to our world and tried to touch one of Ninetales’s tails despite warning of a curse.  Due to your nature as a Gardevoir you selflessly jumped in the way of the curse to shield your trainer from harm.  Ninetales offered to help the trainer to save you from the curse but they had already fled and abandoned you.  As a result of the curse you became an agent of the spirits and now serve in your current role but still hold no resentment towards your trainer and care about them.  Ninetales also foresaw that the selfish and greedy trainer who abandoned you would one day be reborn as a pokemon and bring about many natural disasters.

Due to your role as an agent of the spirits and ability to exist without a physical form you are the [B]Restless Spirit[/B].  If you are killed during game you can still post in the thread and contribute to the game as normal however you will no longer be able vote.

In short, you are [b]Restless Spirit[/b] allied with the [b][color=green]Rescue Teams[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
