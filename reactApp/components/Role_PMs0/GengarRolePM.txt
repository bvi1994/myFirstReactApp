Dear [player],

[spoiler][img]https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/1/1a/Team_Meanies_anime.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Gengar, the leader of Team Meanies from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team series. As a human who turned into a Pokemon and abandoned Gardevoir, you then project your irresponsibility onto Pokemon square by taunting various rescue teams and citizens of the town. You even went as far as framing the main player as the cause for all the natural disasters that’s been going on.

Because you were infamous for framing the player, you are [b]2x framer[/b]. You may PM the hosts “[b][player] is the human caused by Ninetales![/b]. The following effects will happen to this player:

- The kill you did will instead be traced to that player instead of you.
- All alignment checks for that phase will turned “not town-aligned” for that player.

In short, you are [b]2x framer[/b] allied with the [b][color=red]Dark Alliance[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=red]mafia[/color][/b] are eliminated.
