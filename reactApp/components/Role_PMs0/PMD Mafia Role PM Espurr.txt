You are Espurr, one of the younger residents of Serene Village and a student at the village school.  You’re a kind and caring pokemon but you are also brave, calm and calculating when you need to be.  You played your part in helping to defeat the Dark Matter by avoiding being petrified like the rest of the village and playing the role of double agent for the Expedition Society having infiltrated the group of pokemon working for Dark Matter.

Due to your ability to infiltrate and watch from within you are the [B]Watcher[/B].  Each night you may submit the following action; [B]Watch: (Player)[/B] to be informed of anyone who visited that player during the night.

In short, you are [b]Watcher[/b] allied with the [b][color=green]Expedition Society[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
