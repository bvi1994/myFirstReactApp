Dear [player], 

[spoiler][img]https://lparchive.org/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Explorers-of-Sky/Update%2002/26-pmdsky0222.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Diglett from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorer series. As part of Wigglytuff’s guild, you are part of the sentry team. You pretty much identify which Pokemon are coming into Wigglytuff’s guild by looking at the footprints of Pokemon from underground. However, you do sometimes fail to identify certain Pokemon. 

Because you do sentry duty, you are [b]name cop[/b]. Once per night, you can PM the hosts [b]Whose foot print is [player]?!?[/b]. That player will return the name of the character of they are. However, you can only identify for certain which characters are from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorer series. This will be returned in the form of [b]It is [name]! It is [name]![/b]. However, for results you’re not sure of, the player will return [b]Maybe [name]! Maybe [name]![/b]. 

In short, you are [b]Explorer’s Name Cop[/b] allied with the [b][color=green]exploration teams[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
