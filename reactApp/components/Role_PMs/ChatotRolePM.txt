Dear [player],

[spoiler][img]https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/e/ee/441Chatot_PMD_Explorers.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Chatot from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorer Series. You are head of intelligence of the guild and second-in-command to Wigglytuff. You are deeply about your guild master and make sure that the operations of both your boss and the build goes well.

Because you are second in command, you are backup for Wigglytuff. In the event that Wigglytuff gets killed or lynched, you will take over the role of Wigglytuff. Any unused actions from Wigglytuff will be transferred to you for you to use.

Because you also also close to Wigglytuff, you are masons with Wigglytuff. You know your mason is town-aligned.
