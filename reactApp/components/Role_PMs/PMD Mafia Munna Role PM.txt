You are Lady Munna, resident of the Great Glacier the leader of the team of pokemon dedicated to ensuring the Bittercold destroys the world.  You believe the world to be a terrible place where only honest pokemon suffer and seeing your friends suffer along with yourself has only served to strengthen your resolve to support Kyuremï¿½s belief that the world deserves to be destroyed.  You may not care about the fate of the world but you do care about Kyurem and the other pokemon in your team and are completely loyal to them and their cause.

You are a cunning leader who is skilled in deception and are able to manipulate your opponents into destroying themselves; because of this you are the [B]1x Unannounced Destruction Starter[/B].  Once per game during the night you may submit the following action; [B]Start Destruction Tomorrow[/B], during the following day phase the two players with the most votes will be lynched.

In short, you are [b]1x Unannounced Destruction Starter[/b] allied with the [b][color=red]Dark Alliance[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=red]mafia[/color][/b] are eliminated.
