Dear (???)

[spoiler][img]https://s19.postimg.org/iakveycab/PMD_Nuzleaf.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Mr Nuzleaf, the seemingly kindly resident of Serene Village who takes in the hero who has lost their memory.  However behind this benevolent disguise you are a cunning and manipulative pawn in the plot to allow the Dark Matter to destroy the world.  You gained the trust of both the heroes and the village but betrayed them when you tricked them into destroying the sealed spring that could revive the petrified pokemon. You then proceeded to petrify most of the pokemon in the world and root out all remaining resistance.

Due to your turncoat nature you are the [B]Traitor[/B]. Until day three you will not know the identity of your teammates nor they yours making you almost appear as town.  You will be immune to mafia night kills during this time but you will still show as being mafia if you are checked by a cop.

In short, you are [b]Traitor[/b] allied with the [b][color=red]Dark Alliance[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=red]mafia[/color][/b] are eliminated.
