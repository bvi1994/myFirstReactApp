Dear [player],

[spoiler][img]https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/7/7e/Team_ACT_Alakazam_Psychic_GRT.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Alakazam, from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Rescue Team. You are perhaps the most famous member in Team ACT, a very well-respected rescue team that many teams aspire to be. You used your Psychic powers and knowledge to inform the residents of Pokemon square of certain events. 

Because of your Psychic powers and that you seem to know everything, you are a [b]tracker[/b]. For each night phase that you are alive, you may track a player by PMing the hosts [b]Track:[/b] <player>. You will know which players that your target has visited but you will not know what actions have been performed by your target. 

In short, you are a [b]tracker[/b] allied with the [b][color=green]rescue team[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
