Dear [player], 

[spoiler][img]https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/d/de/Victini_arrival_PMDGTI.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Victini from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity. You crashed right into Paradise on the first day of V-wave season with your V-Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel. Being the type of entrepreneur that you are, you realized that some Pokemon do not do well with certain V-waves, you created the V-wheel, which is your pride and joy. You travel all around the world showing off that V-wheel of yours. 

Since the V-wheel has 5 spaces with a certain number of spaces being the good spots, you are a [b]chance gift-giver[/b]. Once per day, you can target a player. That player will spin the V-wheel during the night phase with 5 slots. Some of those slots will be good, bad or neutral. The V-wheel will vary from player to player and from phase to phase. In other words, Player A will have a different V-wheel from Player B. The ability or gift will be received the following day phase. You will know the setup of the V-wheel during the night phase and the results of the spin in the following day phase. 

Since you also travel the world, you have a win condition that you visit a Pokemon from each region. That is, you need to visit a Pokemon from the the Rescue Team series, Explorer Series, Gates to Infinity and Super Mystery Dungeon. You will know which series that the player comes from but not the role, alignment or name of that player. 

In short, you are [b]ITP Gift Giver with a V-wheel[/b] from Paradise and you win when you visit players from all the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series.
