Dear (???)

You are Xatu, a seer who resides atop the hill of the ancients. You spend all day staring into the sun without moving; it is said you can see the past and future and you know of all that is happening in the world.  You were instrumental in helping to save the world when it was threatened by a falling star, using telepathy to warn the pokemon of the world about the star’s approach and helping to create a teleport gem to send the world heroes to the sky to prevent this.

Due to your abilities as a seer, you are the [B]3x Night Action Getter[/B].  Three times per game during the night you can submit the action [B]Night Action Getter[/B].  At the beginning of the following day phase you will be informed of all the actions that were used during the night but not who used them or who they used them on.

In short, you are [b]3x Night Action Getter[/b] allied with the [b][color=green]Rescue Teams[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
