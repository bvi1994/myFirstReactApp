You are Magnezone, the primary sheriff officer in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorer series. After the fugitive Pokemon are captured by the exploration teams, you arrest them and bring them to justice, whatever justice might be. You also maintain the list of wanted Pokemon that gets passed around. 

Because you are the main sheriff of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Series, you are an [b]alignment cop[/b]. Once per night, you may PM the hosts [b]Bzzzt Bzzzt [player][/b]. The results will return the alignment of the selected player. 

In short, you are [b]alignment cop[/b] allied with the Exploration Teams and you win when all threats to [b][color=green]town[/color][/b] are eliminated.
