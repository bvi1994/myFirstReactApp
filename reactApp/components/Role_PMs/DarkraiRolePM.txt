Dear [player],

[spoiler][img]https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/e/eb/Darkrai_%28game%29.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20110422064704[//img][/spoiler]

You are Darkrai from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorer Series. Although the main plot focused mainly on Primal Dialga, it was actually you that pretty much caused the near destruction of Temporal Tower and the dark future should the characters have failed to stop that destruction. You communicate through players through dreams, though you cause terrible nightmares to the citizens of Treasure Town.

Because of your desire to take over the world, you are [b]ITP Serial Killer[/b]. Since your preferred method is haunting others through dreams, once per night, you may PM the hosts [b]Give nightmares to [player][/b]. You will attempt to give your target a nightmare and if successful, will be notified about the nightmare. If you survive the end of the following night, that player will die at the following night, bypassing any protection they may have. 

To help you take over the world, you have [b]1x bulletproof[/b]. This will protect you from night kills once per game.

In short you are [b]1x Bulletproof Serial Killer through Nightmares[/b] and you win when you are the last one standing and/or nothing will prevent this from happening.
