Dear [player],

You are Dusknoir, one of the main antagonists in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorer series. You were introduced as a great explorer who is very wise and solving mysteries. However, it turns out that you are working for Primial Dialga to pursue the main characters and Grovyle to prevent time from flowing properly.

As you were able to con most of the protagonists in the game, you are [b]Godfather[/b] until the end of Night 3. All alignment checks on you until Day 4 will return as “town-aligned.” In addition, you are [b]vengeful[/b], should you be lynched or killed in anyway, you can attempt to nightkill a player as revenge. You will not attempt the nightkill on that player if it will lead to a -YLO situation and you will not get another nightfall. In addition, you have 2x ninja. Twice in this game, you may PM the hosts [b]Ninja Kill: [player][/b]. This will make your kill untraceable in any way if your kill is successful.

In short, you are [b]Godfather Ninja Vengeful[/b] allied with the [b][color=red]Dark Alliance[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=red]mafia[/color][/b] are eliminated.
