Dear (???)

[spoiler][img]https://s19.postimg.org/tmxgwsapf/PMD_Kyurem.png[/img][/spoiler]

You are Kyurem, legendary pokemon and resident of the Great Glacier.  You have foreseen the future of the pokemon world and it’s destruction at the hands of the Bittercold, however given the state of the pokemon world and the perceived selfish and distrustful nature of the pokemon who live in it you believe it deserves to be destroyed and is a fate that cannot be avoided or changed.  To ensure this future is allowed to happen you personally guard the Bittercold’s location in the Great Glacier and have recruited Munna and her group of pokemon who are disillusioned with the world to help you hunt down anyone who wishes to change the worlds fate.  You are particularly ruthless towards humans who have come to this world as pokemon in order to do this whom you utterly destroy without mercy in order to send their souls back to their own world.

Due to your completely ruthless nature and willingness to do anything to ensure nothing interferes the world’s destruction you are the [B]2x Strongman[/B].  Twice per game during the night you can submit the action [B]Strongman Kill: (Player)[/B] in order to kill a player and bypass protections from a Doctor or other protective roles.

In short, you are [b]2x Strongman[/b] allied with the [b][color=red]Dark Alliance[/color][/b] and you win when all threats to [b][color=red]mafia[/color][/b] are eliminated.
